# Nutrition Assistant UI Prototype

A React Native (Expo) prototype that explores a meal logging experience where users upload meal photos, view a calorie and macro summary, and receive gentle guidance from an AI nutrition assistant.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

Launch the Expo development tools, then open the project on an iOS or Android simulator/device or the web preview.

## Tech stack

- [Expo](https://expo.dev/) with React Native and TypeScript
- [NativeWind](https://www.nativewind.dev/) for Tailwind CSS styling semantics
- Mock data only â€” no backend integration yet
